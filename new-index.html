                    Hello! My name is Sammi Moore, I am 25 years old, and I graduated from Northern Arizona University in
                    April 2021 with a Master's in Science Teaching. After realizing that I wasn't entirely interested in
                    pursuing a job in teaching, I decided to change directions and learn how to code. My background is
                    heavily focused on human anatomy and physiology, exercise physiology, metabolic pathways, and how to
                    effectively teach science. Coding was a foreign concept to me, as I never took a coding course
                    throughout my entire schooling experience. But through the University of Arizona's coding bootcamp I plan to gain the skills
                    and knowledge required to become a proficient programmer.

                <div class="col-12 mb-2">
                    My goal is to eventually land a remote programming job, that will provide me with both stability and
                    flexibility. I am still figuring out what areas of coding I want to specialize in, but once I decide I
                    will begin to hone my skills to ensure I have a solid grasp on specific programming languages. I have
                    been working hard to create a portfolio that will showcase the projects I have created throughout the
                    bootcamp. Below I have provided links to all of my major projects, as well as a link to my GitHub where
