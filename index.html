                Hello! My name is Sammi Moore, I am 25 years old, and I just recently graduated from Northern Arizona University with a Master's in Science Teaching. After realizing that I wasn't entirely interested in pursuing a job in teaching, I decided to completely change directions and learn how to code. My background is heavily focused on human anatomy and physiology, exercise physiology, metabolic pathways, and how to effectively teach science. Coding was a completely foreign concept to me, as I never took a coding course throughout my entire schooling experience. But through UofA's coding bootcamp I plan to gain the skills and knowledge required to become a proficient programmer. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My goal is to eventually land a remote programming job, that will provide me with both stability and flexibility. I am still figuring out what areas of coding I want to specialize in, but once I decide I will begin to hone my skills to ensure I have a solid grasp on specific programming languages. I have been working hard to create a portfolio that will showcase the projects I have created throughout the bootcamp. Below I have provided links to all of my major projects, as well as a link to my GitHub where my various code files can be viewed. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This page was created to showcase my background, work, and interests. Outside of coding I also enjoy rock climbing, biking, hiking, lifting weights, construction, and drawing. Thank you for stopping by to puruse my page, and if you have any questions or would like to contact me do not hesitate to reach out via email or phone call which can be found in the "Contact Me" section.
