# Description
The goal of this project was to design a responsive and creative professional portfolio to showcase my prior and future coding projects. This professional portfolio is meant to provide potential employers with information about myself and the coding work I have conducted. The purpose of creating this professional portfolio webpage is to have a space where I can easily organize, update, and present projects I have created. 

This portfolio webpage is accessible and contains navigation links, images, and contact information. It was designed to be user-friendly and allow for effortless navigation and discovery.
