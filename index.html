            <p>
                Hello! My name is Sammi Moore, I am 25 years old, and I graduated from Northern Arizona University in
                April 2021 with a Master's in Science Teaching. After realizing that I wasn't entirely interested in
                pursuing a job in teaching, I decided to change directions and learn how to code. My background is
                heavily focused on human anatomy and physiology, exercise physiology, metabolic pathways, and how to
                effectively teach science. Coding was a foreign concept to me, as I never took a coding course
                throughout my entire schooling experience. But through the University of Arizona's coding bootcamp I plan to gain the skills
                and knowledge required to become a proficient programmer.
                <br>
                <br>
                My goal is to eventually land a remote programming job, that will provide me with both stability and
                flexibility. I am still figuring out what areas of coding I want to specialize in, but once I decide I
                will begin to hone my skills to ensure I have a solid grasp on specific programming languages. I have
                been working hard to create a portfolio that will showcase the projects I have created throughout the
                bootcamp. Below I have provided links to all of my major projects, as well as a link to my GitHub where
                my various code files can be viewed.
                <br>
                <br>
                This page was created to showcase my background, work, and interests. Outside of coding I also enjoy
                rock climbing, biking, hiking, lifting weights, construction, and drawing. Thank you for stopping by to
                peruse my page, and if you have any questions or would like to contact me do not hesitate to reach out
                via email or phone, which can be found in the "Contact Me" section.
